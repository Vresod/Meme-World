<h2>Instagram Egg</h2>
<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>On January 4, 2019 an Instagram account(@world_record_egg) uploaded a stock image of an egg, and suddenly it exploded and became the most liked photo on instagram.</p>
<p>There would be more detail, but because it is just an egg, I cannot express as much information and detail that I would want too.</p>
