  <h1>Welcome to Meme World!</h1>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This site is not like Know your Meme, although you should check that website out. This website will educate you on memes in general, unlike know your meme which will single out the most popular memes, and tell you the backstory, My website will tell you all about the whole categories of memes.</p>
  <p>Some of the biggest memes right now are Big Chungus, the latest Sprite commercial, and Thanos. In fact the whole of the avengers series is making a comeback with memes because of other memes that have been created (past or present).</p>

  <p>As you can see, this type of millenial humor is very, very weird. Although this type of humor may seem out of the ordinary, kids my age, and older, love this type of comedy, and it is very easy to understand.</p>
